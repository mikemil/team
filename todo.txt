TODO 
**********************************************************************************************************8

Combine Calendar and Events page - to use the calendar  
    then need to get the events from the eventSvc not hard-coded

Click on date without an event - defaults to add event  - prompt Done
  but now need to create the post (or put) rest method to add events

Click on a date in the calendar w/o an event - default to Add event
  which will prompt for the title, etc - and call eventSvc to create a new event    

Create controllers for each pages
* details -  add service call to use $http with request parameter id
* about  - should be minor - not much on that page
* contact - should be minor - not mucn on that page either

Figure out content for other pages

List of teams - even if only 1 right now - rather than only 1 team

combine events / teams - to get results for each team member 
   need to think about the data model so that I can show the results
   from a previous meet. Which includes getting to results from the Team member list.

Results need to capture a viarable number of exercises, generally bean, bars, floor and vault
   but need to handle cases where they only do a couple exercises.
