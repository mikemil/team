**********************************************************************************************************
TODO 
**********************************************************************************************************
Create form to allow add/edit of team members

Try adding a small X i in the corner of any calendar entry 
  - make it clickable and that X means to delete the calendar entry or some other way of deleting entries
    assuming you have the privileges

Start looking at how to implement security
  * allow creation of team member, if create privileges
  * allow creation of event on the calendar if calendar-add privileges

Create controllers for each pages
* details -  add service call to use $http with request parameter id
* about  - should be minor - not much on that page
* contact - should be minor - not mucn on that page either

May want to update the event service to take the month for the calendar 
  and then the service should only get events for that month.
  Currently looks like it is getting ALL events and filtering them out

List of teams - even if only 1 right now - rather than only 1 team

combine events / teams - to get results for each team member 
   need to think about the data model so that I can show the results
   from a previous meet. Which includes getting to results from the Team member list.

Results need to capture a viarable number of exercises, generally bean, bars, floor and vault
   but need to handle cases where they only do a couple exercises.
